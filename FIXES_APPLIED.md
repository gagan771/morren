# ✅ All Errors Fixed!

## What Was Fixed

The application had missing files that were accidentally deleted. I've recreated all of them:

### 1. **lib/mock-data.ts**
- Contains sample data for users, items, orders, and bids
- Provides helper functions to get related data
- Essential for the dashboards to display information

### 2. **components/dashboard-layout.tsx**
- Premium sidebar navigation component
- Role-based theming (Buyer: Purple, Seller: Emerald, Admin: Rose)
- Responsive and collapsible design

### 3. **app/page.tsx**
- Landing page with dark mode design
- Uses Aceternity UI components (Background Beams, 3D Cards)
- Navigation to all three dashboards

### 4. **Dependencies Installed**
- `framer-motion` - For animations
- `mini-svg-data-uri` - For SVG utilities

## ✨ The Application Now Has

- **Premium UI** with Shadcn and Aceternity components
- **3D Interactive Cards** that respond to mouse movement
- **Background Beams** for atmospheric effects
- **Professional Sidebar Navigation** for all dashboards
- **Glassmorphism** and modern design patterns
- **Role-based color themes** for visual distinction

## 🚀 Ready to Use

The application is now fully functional. Run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then visit:
- **Landing Page**: http://localhost:3000
- **Buyer Dashboard**: http://localhost:3000/dashboard/buyer
- **Seller Dashboard**: http://localhost:3000/dashboard/seller
- **Admin Dashboard**: http://localhost:3000/dashboard/admin

All errors are resolved! 🎉
